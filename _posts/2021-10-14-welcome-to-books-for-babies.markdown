Welcome! You've found our _Books For Babies_ program.
This is our first post. We can put stuff here about the pilot
program run at GVH. And about writing a grant and getting money
for _this_ project, from CHOP, to expand to more hospitals.

You could make monthly posts here that would highlight all the
great things this program is accomplishing, or feature a person/helper
profile here to thank them for their hard work getting this program
up and running...

Check out the [the chop web site][chop] and [the gvh website][gvh] for more info.
